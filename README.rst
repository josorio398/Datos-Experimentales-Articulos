Solubility Models Library
=========================

The analysis of multicomponent systems leads to elucidate or in its effect to describe in an approximate way the different phenomena
as molecular interactions between the components of a system.

Understanding the behavior of these phenomena allows the development of theoretical models to predict the different properties of the
system, generating computer tools that, in addition to facilitating the analysis, allow a better understanding of the different factors
involved in the solution process.

One of the most important properties is **solubility**, since it is one of the most important stages in the research and development of pharmaceutical 
products, since it affects the biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic characteristics of the pharmaceutical forms. It is, therefore, that one of the 
most important lines of research in solution thermodynamics are mathematical models that allow predicting solubility with very low error ranges.

Solubility Models 
=================

Solubility Models is a module of the **Thermodinamic Solution Library** for the calculation of fit parameters, 
statisticians and graphical representation of calculated values and experimental values of models such as :

- Modified Apelblat
- van't Hoff
- van't Hoff-Yaws
- Modified Wilson
- Buchowski Ksiazaczak Î»h 
- NRTL
- Wilson
- Weibull of two parameters
  
Installation 
============

TermodynamicSolutions may be installed using pip...
  
.. code:: python

    !pip install ThermodynamicSolutions

To import the SolubilityModels module you can use:

.. code:: python

    from TermodynamicSolutions import SolubilityModels

Classes of Solubility Models
============================

The Solubility Models module essentially uses two classes for computational analysis, the class ``model``, is 
used for the analysis of data from a particular model, the class ``models`` is used for the analysis of such 
data in all solubility models.
